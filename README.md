# Desargues-theorem
A 3d demonstration of Desargues theorem written in Elica Logo
-------------------------------------------------------------
Elica is a very unpopular language written on top of openGL best suitable for geometrical/physical demonstrations. Other project I've seen written in this language is a small game.

Desargues theorem is a theorem about triangles in 2d and 3d space and you can read more about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27_theorem

This is a small project I made for one of my courses in university. The program allows the user to enter the coordinates of the vertexes of 2 triangles and then the program visualises those triangles and if they are [perspective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues'_theorem), the program shows:
 - axis of perspectivity - in light blue
 - center of perspectivity - in a dashed purple line
